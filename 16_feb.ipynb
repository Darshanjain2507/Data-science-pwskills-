    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL--> It stands for structured Query Language which stores the data in the form of rows and columns.\n",
    "no-SQL-->it is used to store image,audio,video..etc types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL-->It stands for data defination language.\n",
    "CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).\n",
    "DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.\n",
    "ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.\n",
    "TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language\n",
    "and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database.\n",
    "Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of DML commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.\n",
    "UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.\n",
    "DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL Command is to get\n",
    "some schema relation based on the query passed to it. \n",
    "List of DQL: \n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. \n",
    "A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated\n",
    "by the database according to a defined sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: \n",
    "A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. \n",
    "It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "# import mysql.connector\n",
    "#create user 'user'@'%' identified by 'password'\n",
